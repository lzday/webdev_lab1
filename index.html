  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>I am a third year cs student, but since I have yet to learn any webdev (not a required topic at my school), I'm trying out this course.</p>
  <p>I primarily use Python and Java, but am also semi-proficient in C, C++, and a couple of other languages (due to course work).</p>
  <p>In my free time, I like to dabble in various hobbies. One that I really liked in the past was jigsaw puzzles. Recently, I've been getting into bracelet/cord making.</p>
